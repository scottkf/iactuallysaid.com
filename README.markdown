## Post installation

1. Remove all .example extensions from files under the config/ folder and edit the info inside. Though the ability to use oauth to login is built in and works, I never incorporated it into the site. Going to /auth/twitter, will work, for example. Though it will redirect to localhost:3000, this can be changed in `mongoose_auth.coffee`.
